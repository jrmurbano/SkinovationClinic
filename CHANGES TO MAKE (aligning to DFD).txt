Changes (aligning to DFD):

1. On patient side calendar view, there's an error in displaying selected service (works okay on package and products) but can't schedule an apointment anymore due to this error.
- Rescheduling and Cancelling Request from patients side can only available until 1 day before the appointment. On the day of the appointment, these buttons should be disabled.

2. Now, back to the Appointment Scheduler and let's add Appointment Reminders and Notification, add a notification icon across all interfaces of both admin and patient (top right of interface, icon must be font awesome). When the admin confirms appointment/reschedules, it sets a notification to be sent on both admin and patient the day before the appointment and on the day apointment. Please choose an appropriate notification sound.

When the admin confirms cancellation, it must remove the notification. Don't forget the provide me the SQL query I needed to execute.

The notifications table should be this
- notification_id
- [foreign keys]
- message
- is_read

The patient must be able to "Mark as Read" a notification and admin can see if patient already marked as read them.

3. Start applying availability limitations consdering 3 attendants only per hour. Also make the taken slot hours grey on the calendar for patients

4. If all above is fixed, working, and if you still can, let's proceed to improving the Patient Profile Manager.
On patient's interface, there should be 6 sections in the content displayed horizontally.
- Personal Profile
- Medical Profile
- Availed Services
- Availed Packages
- Availed Products
- Account Settings (where the patient could change their username and password)

All changes shall be visible to admin, too.
