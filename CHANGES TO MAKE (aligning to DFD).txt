Changes:
1. Booking and Rescheduling a service, package, and preordering a product work just fine. Cancellation doesn't work.
2. add a notification bell icon across all interfaces of both admin and patient (top right of interface, icon must be font awesome). When the admin confirms appointment/reschedules, it sets a notification to be sent on both admin and patient the day before the appointment and on the day apointment. There may be a notification functionalities and sound already in this project folder.

When the admin confirms cancellation, it must remove the notification.
