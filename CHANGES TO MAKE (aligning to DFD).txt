Changes (aligning to DFD):

1. add a notification bell icon across all interfaces of both admin and patient (top right of interface, icon must be font awesome). When the admin confirms appointment/reschedules, it sets a notification to be sent on both admin and patient the day before the appointment and on the day apointment. Please choose an appropriate notification sound.

When the admin confirms cancellation, it must remove the notification.

The notifications table is this
- notification_id
- [foreign keys]
- message
- is_read

The patient must be able to "Mark as Read" a notification and admin can see if patient already marked as read them.

2. If all above is fixed, working, and if you still can, let's proceed to improving the Patient Profile Manager.
add the following to the patient fields mag register sila
- Address
- Gender
- Civil Status
- Birthday
- Occupation
- Account Settings (where the patient could change their username and password)

All changes shall be visible to admin, too.

3. Add owner view
