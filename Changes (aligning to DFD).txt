Changes (aligning to DFD):

1. On patient side calendar view, there's an error in dates. When I select a date on the calendar, it changes into -1 date when date is displayed on the Select Appointment Time part and  again when Continue Booking button is clicked and it shows another -1 date. Please fix. Also in this modal, it should only display the following
- Selected Date
- Selected Time
- Selected Service/Package/Product: (only displayed the already selected service/package/product, remove redundant dropdown button)
- Amount to be paid (in Philippine peso)
Please add placeholders and font awesome icons on the modal please.
After this should be a text box and next to it says "I agree with the clinic's policy in appointments". The policy word should be clickable and show another modal again that display the list of policy. Please improve how I word it into a formal one
- Rescheduling and Cancelling Request from patients side shoud only available until 1 day before the appointment. On the day of the appointment, these buttons should be disabled.

2. Now, back to the Appointment Scheduler and let's add Appointment Reminders and Notification, add a notification icon across all interfaces of both admin and patient (top right of interface, icon must be font awesome). When the admin confirms appointment/reschedules, it sets a notification to be sent on both admin and patient the day before the appointment and on the day apointment. Please choose an appropriate notification sound.

When the admin confirms cancellation, it must remove the notification. Don't forget the provide me the SQL query I needed to execute.

The notifications table should be this
- notification_id
- [foreign keys]
- message
- is_read

The patient must be able to "Mark as Read" a notification and admin can see if patient already marked as read them.
